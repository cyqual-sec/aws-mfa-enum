# AWS MFA Enum

This simple script attempts to enumerate the MFA status of the root user/email account of an AWS account.

If only a single U2F key (passkey) is attached to the account, AWS leaks the key's arn, including the associated AWS account ID. In such instances, this script will also parse the arn and display both the account ID and MFA serial number.

# Usage

The script takes either a single email or a file of emails with one address per line

```bash
python aws-mfa-enum.py [-h] (-e EMAIL | -f FILE)
```

# Output Examples

This script will output either a list of the registered MFA methods or "NONE". Note that "NONE" is the reponse both for AWS accounts that exist and are not protected by MFA as well as for email addresses that are not associated with AWS accounts.

Single MFA method is registered without a leaked account ID

```bash
email@domain.tld: SW
```

Multiple MFA methods are registered without a leaked account ID

```bash
email@domain.tld: MULTI - SW, U2F
```

Only a single U2F key is registered for MFA, leaking the account ID

```bash
email@domain.tld: U2F - 123456789012 - keyname-LONGKEYID
```
